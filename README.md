# Google Classrom Quickstart

This project is derived from the official Java Quickstart [Java Quickstart](https://developers.google.com/classroom/quickstart/java). Begin this project by completing Step 1.

## Step 1: Turn on the Classroom API
1. Create a directory src/main/resources
2. Click the **ENABLE THE CLASSROOM API** button on Step 1 of [Java Quickstart](https://developers.google.com/classroom/quickstart/java) to create a new Cloud Platform project and automatically enable the Classroom API.
3. In resulting dialog click **DOWNLOAD CLIENT CONFIGURATION** and save the file credentials.json to the [directory](src/main/resources) you created. 

## Step 2: Prepare the project

You can skip this step. I created the project for you in this template.

## Step 3: Set up the sample

1. Create a directory src/main/java
2. Create a new Java class ClassroomQuickstart.java in that directory.
3. Copy the code from the website (note the copy button in the upper right corner of the code) and replace **ALL** of the code with the sample code.

## Step 4: Run the sample

1. Run the sample using IntelliJ Run...
2. The first time you run the sample, it will prompt you to authorize access:
    1. The sample will attempt to open a new window or tab in your default browser. If this fails, copy the URL from the console and manually open it in your browser.
    1. If you are not already logged into your Google account, you will be prompted to log in. If you are logged into multiple Google accounts, you will be asked to select one account to use for the authorization.
    1. Click the Accept button.
   The sample will proceed automatically, and you may close the window/tab.
